# Fixed point counting and character table of finite monoid

System-gap experimental code with functions to compute
  - the bicharacter of L and D classes
  - the bicharcater of the regular representation of a finite monoid
  - the radical of an L-class of a finite monoid M as a CCM-mod
  - its bicharacter
  - the character table of CCM
  - the Cartan matrix of CCM

## TODO:
  - [ ] Clean up code
